# Real-time Cricket Data Scraping System

## Overview

Welcome to the **Real-time Cricket Data Scraping System**! This project is designed to scrape live cricket match data from the CREX website, including match schedules, match information, squads, live scores, and scorecards. By utilizing the power of web scraping and automation, the system monitors upcoming cricket matches, fetching relevant data as soon as a match is scheduled to start.

Whether you're a cricket enthusiast or someone looking to integrate match data into your own system, this project offers a simple and efficient way to track match updates in real-time.

## Features

- **Live Data Scraping**: Automatically fetches live cricket match data, including schedules, squads, and scores.
- **Periodic Monitoring**: Runs at scheduled intervals to fetch and update match data.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to scrape other data sources with minimal changes.
- **Automated Match Detection**: Tracks and fetches match details when a match is about to start.

## Project Structure

Here’s the project structure and description of the key files:

```
/cricket-data-scraper
├── app.py             # Main Python script to run the scraper
├── .gitignore         # Excludes unnecessary files (like virtual environments and logs)
├── requirements.txt   # Lists Python dependencies
├── README.md          # Project documentation
```

## Requirements

This project requires Python 3.x and several dependencies, which can be easily installed using `pip`. To install all dependencies, follow the instructions below.

### Installing Dependencies

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cricket-data-scraper.git
    cd cricket-data-scraper
    ```

2. Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
    - **Windows**:
      ```bash
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - **macOS/Linux**:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

4. Install the required dependencies using `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## How to Run

Once you’ve installed the dependencies, you can run the scraper with a simple command. The script will automatically start scraping cricket data and will continue to monitor and fetch updates on scheduled matches.

1. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. The script will begin by fetching the match schedule from the CREX website and continue monitoring for live match data.

## How It Works

### **app.py**

This is the core file that initiates the scraping process. It uses:

- **Selenium**: To automate the browser and interact with JavaScript-based pages.
- **BeautifulSoup**: To parse and extract data from the fetched HTML content.
- **Schedule**: To run the scraper at regular intervals, ensuring real-time data updates.
- **Requests**: To handle HTTP requests when needed.

### **.gitignore**

The `.gitignore` file ensures that unnecessary files (like virtual environments, logs, and sensitive information) are excluded from version control.

```gitignore
# Ignore virtual environments
venv/
# Ignore Python bytecode
*.pyc
# Ignore log files
*.log
# Ignore environment files
.env
```

### **requirements.txt**

This file contains all the required Python packages for the project. To install the necessary libraries, run the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Future Enhancements

While the current system is designed to fetch cricket match schedules and data from the CREX website, there are several opportunities for expansion:

- **Multiple Data Sources**: Extend the scraper to pull data from multiple cricket websites.
- **Match Alerts**: Implement email or SMS notifications when a match starts or ends.
- **Data Storage**: Store scraped data in a database for easy retrieval and analysis.
